# Customarker: Academic assistant for marking
<br />
<b> Requirements: </b>
<br />
For your final year projects you will be marked by two academics: a supervisor and a second assessor. Each of them will fill a spreadsheet that needs to be customised to include the details of the student (registration number and full name) and the project title. This process is quite laborious with the growth of the number of students.<br />
Customarker will help producing these customised forms. It will receive in input a list of students and projects’ titles in either XLS, XLSX or CSV and two XLSX templates (one for the supervisor and one for the second assessor) and will generate the customised marking forms. These should be grouped by academic names (e.g., one folder per academic with their marking forms).<br />
Customarker needs to be robust to changes made to the inputs. For example, the order of the columns of the list of students should be irrelevant for the functioning of the program. Also, if some information about a student is missing, the program should notify the user.<br />
The program should also offer a function to generate a report file with the final marks of each student as they appear in the supervisor’s forms. This function will get a zip file containing one folder per academic and will collate all the marks in specific cells of the marking forms into a new spreadsheet.
